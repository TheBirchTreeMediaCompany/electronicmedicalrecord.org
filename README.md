KONA 2.3 EMR CLIENT BUNDLE FROM www.electronicmedicalrecord.org
ABOUT KONA     2.3 EMR CLIENT
 

Introducing the KONA 2.3 EMR Client from ElectronicMedicalRecord.org. Kona, short for KeKona, means second born. Kekona, a mixed breed service animal from Chicago IL is the EMR Client mascot and the meaning behind the name KONA. Kekona is a safe and secure pet that helps ease patients conditions much like our EMR client. At electronicmedicalrecord.org we strive to be safe, secure, and different. EMR differently.

 

WE KNOW THE WAY
 

We know the KONA 2.3 EMR client works because we have extensively tested the system and have completed mock visits, insurance history, and medications for test patients in a live format to show you what we mean. There is nothing we want to do more that to provide your organization with an effective and secure Electronic Medical Record software system.

 

SUPPORT
 

Live chat assitance is available to all KONA 2.3 ElectronicMedicalRecord.org clients. You will have phone, text, email, and chat support with your EMR. We are available 24/7. For clients with special requirements, staff can respond physically to your facility to provide on site technical support and training.

We use an open source medical practice management application (EHR EMR PMS) featuring fully integrated electronic health records, scheduling, electronic billing, internationalization, free support, a vibrant community, and a whole lot more.
